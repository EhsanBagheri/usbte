Web USB terminal emulator

This uses webusb/winusb to allow a webpage to become a terminal emulator for a cdc/acm serial port USB device!

Click "Connect" to select your cdc/acm serial port USB device and then enter commands in the command line!

Your cdc/acm serial port USB device must not be claimed by usbser.sys or you will get an access denied error.
