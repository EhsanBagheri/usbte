Note that for Ubuntu Linux, assuming username "ubuntu", to allow the browser to access USB serial ports, run these two commands:

  sudo adduser ubuntu dialout
  sudo adduser root dialout

then log out and log back in.

Note some distros use "uucp" rather than "dialout" group.

Using Ubuntu Live, you can't completely log out, so after doing so, you can effectively re-log in and re-launch the browser again with:

  sudo su - ubuntu
  google-chrome
