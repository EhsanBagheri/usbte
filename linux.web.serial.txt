Note that for Ubuntu Linux, assuming username "ubuntu", to allow the browser to access USB serial ports, run these two commands:

  sudo usermod -a -G dialout ubuntu
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout root

then log out and log back in.

You may also have to:

  systemctl stop brltty-udev.service
  sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service
  systemctl stop brltty.service
  systemctl disable brltty.service
